# Issues

1. Make sure you have installed the
latest version Taterzens installed.

2. Get the logs from
`.minecraft/logs/latest.log`
and crash reports (if crash occured)
`.minecraft/crash-reports/crash<date>.txt`.

3. Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/samolego/Taterzens/issues/new/choose) containing all
the needed mentioned information.

# How do I achieve &lt;xyz&gt;?

1. [Docs](https://samolego.github.io/Taterzens/)
are a great place to start looking for features.
You even have a search function up there :).

2. You can also join the
[discord](https://discord.gg/9PAesuHFnp) for
further information. Someone might already had
a similar issue, so you can try searching for it
using discord's builtin search.

If you need more information,
don't be afraid to ask ;)!
(just make sure to use the right channel)
